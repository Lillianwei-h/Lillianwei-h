Hi! I'm Siwei Han(韩偲蔚), a senior at Fudan University, Computer Science and Technology Department. I am interested in alignment and application of LLMs, VLMs and multimodal models, currently interning in [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io)'s team at UNC.

For more details please have a look at my [homepage](https://lillianwei-h.github.io).
